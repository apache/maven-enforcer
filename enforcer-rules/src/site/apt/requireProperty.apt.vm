Require Property

  This rule can enforce that a declared property is set and optionally evaluate it against a regular expression.

  The following parameters are supported by this rule:
   
  * <<property>> - the property to evaluate.
   
  * <<message>> - an optional message to the user if the rule fails. Default is: "Property 'xxx' is required for this build".
   
  * <<regex>> - an optional regular expression used to check the value of the property.
   
  * <<regexMessage>> - an optional message to the user if the regex check fails.

  []

  The regex is applied to the entire value of the property (i.e. using the regex "match" method),
  and not just a substring of the property value.
