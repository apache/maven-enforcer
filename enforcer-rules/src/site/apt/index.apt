  The following built-in rules ship along with the enforcer plugin:

  * {{{./alwaysFail.html}alwaysFail}} - Always fail... used to test plugin configuration.

  * {{{./alwaysPass.html}alwaysPass}} - Always passes... used to test plugin configuration.

  * {{{./banDependencyManagementScope.html}banDependencyManagementScope}} - bans all scope values except for 'import' from dependencies within the dependency management.
  
  * {{{./banDistributionManagement.html}banDistributionManagement}} - enforces that project doesn't have distributionManagement.
  
  * {{{./banDuplicatePomDependencyVersions.html}banDuplicatePomDependencyVersions}} - enforces that the project doesn't have duplicate declared dependencies.
  
  * {{{./banDynamicVersions.html}banDynamicVersions}} - bans all dependencies requiring version resolution at build time (i.e. version ranges, placeholders <<<RELEASE>>>/<<<LATEST>>> or SNAPSHOT versions).
  
  * {{{./bannedDependencies.html}bannedDependencies}} - enforces that excluded dependencies aren't included.
  
  * {{{./bannedPlugins.html}bannedPlugins}} - enforces that specific plugins aren't included in the build.
  
  * {{{./bannedRepositories.html}bannedRepositories}} - enforces to not include banned repositories.

  * {{{./banTransitiveDependencies.html}banTransitiveDependencies}} - enforces that project doesn't have transitive dependencies.

  * {{{./dependencyConvergence.html}dependencyConvergence}} - ensure all dependencies converge to the same version.

  * {{{./evaluateBeanshell.html}evaluateBeanshell}} - evaluates a beanshell script.

  * {{{./externalRules.html}externalRules}} - evaluate rules from an external resource.

  * {{{./reactorModuleConvergence.html}reactorModuleConvergence}} - enforces that a multi module build follows best practice.

  * {{{./requireActiveProfile.html}requireActiveProfile}} - enforces one or more active profiles.
  
  * {{{./requireEnvironmentVariable.html}requireEnvironmentVariable}} - enforces the existence of an environment variable.

  * {{{./requireExplicitDependencyScope.html}requireExplicitDependencyScope}} - enforces that all dependencies have an explicit scope.

  * {{{./requireFileChecksum.html}requireFileChecksum}} - enforces that the specified file has a certain checksum.
  
  * {{{./requireFilesDontExist.html}requireFilesDontExist}} - enforces that the list of files does not exist.
  
  * {{{./requireFilesExist.html}requireFilesExist}} - enforces that the list of files does exist.

  * {{{./requirePrerequisite.html}requirePrerequisite}} - enforces that prerequisites have been specified.
   
  * {{{./requireProfileIdsExist.html}requireProfileIdsExist}} - enforces the existence of profiles specified on the commandline.
   
  * {{{./requireProperty.html}requireProperty}} - enforces the existence and values of properties.
   
  * {{{./requireReleaseDeps.html}requireReleaseDeps}} - enforces that no snapshots are included as dependencies.

  * {{{./requireReleaseVersion.html}requireReleaseVersion}} - enforces that the artifact is not a snapshot.

  * {{{./requireSnapshotVersion.html}requireSnapshotVersion}} - enforces that the artifact is not a release.

  * {{{./requireSameVersions.html}requireSameVersions}} - enforces that specific dependencies and/or plugins have the same version.

  * {{{./requireTextFileChecksum.html}requireTextFileChecksum}} - enforces that the specified text file has a certain checksum (after normalizing line separators).
