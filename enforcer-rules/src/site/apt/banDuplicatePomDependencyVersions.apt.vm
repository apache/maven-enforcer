Ban Duplicate Pom Dependency Versions

  This rule checks that there are no duplicate dependencies declared in the POM of the project.
  Duplicate dependencies are dependencies which have the same group id, artifact id, type and classifier.

  Sample Plugin Configuration:
  
+------+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>no-duplicate-declared-dependencies</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>enforce</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>
                <banDuplicatePomDependencyVersions/>
              </rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
