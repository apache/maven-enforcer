Require Matching Coordinates

  This rule checks that the Maven coordinates (i.e. the project's <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>>) each match a given pattern. 
  Optionally one can also enforce that in a multi-module build the module directory name is always equal to the module's <<<artifactId>>>.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * <<message>> - an optional message to the user if the rule fails. If not set a default message will be used.

   * <<groupIdPattern>> - an optional {{{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/}regular expression}}, which must match the project's <<<groupId>>>. If not set there is no check on the <<<groupId>>>.

   * <<artifactIdPattern>> - an optional {{{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/}regular expression}}, which must match the project's <<<artifactId>>>. If not set there is no check on the <<<artifactId>>>.

   * <<moduleNameMustMatchArtifactId>> - boolean flag to enforce that the the module's directory name is always equal to the module's <<<artifactId>>>. By default <<<false>>>.
