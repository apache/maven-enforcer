Require File Size

  This rule checks that the specified list of files exist and are within the specified size range.


   The following parameters are supported by this rule:
   
   * <<message>> - an optional message to the user if the rule fails.
   
   * <<files>> - A list of files to check. If this list is empty, the main project artifact will be checked.
   
   * <<maxsize>> - maximum size in bytes for this file.
   
   * <<minsize>> - minimum size in bytes for this file.

   * <<recursive>> - the mode for computing the size when the files are directories. Default is <<false>>, so the size reflects the directory itself and not its contents. If set to <<true>>, the size is computed by summing up the sizes of all files under the designated directory recursively.
   
   * <<allowNulls>> - If null files should be allowed. If allowed, they will be treated as if they do exist. Default is false.

   * <<satisfyAny>> - Allows that one of files can make the rule pass, instead of all the files. Default is false.
