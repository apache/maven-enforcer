Require Transitive Provided Dependencies in Runtime Classpath

  Checks that the runtime class path (e.g. used by Maven Plugins via the 
  {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-maven-classloading.html#3-plugin-classloaders}Plugin Classloader}}) contains all transitive provided dependencies.
  As those are not transitively inherited they need to be declared explicitly in the pom.xml of the using Maven project.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:

   * excludes - a list of dependencies to skip. Their transitive dependencies are not evaluated either. The format is groupId[:artifactId][:version][:type][:scope][:classifier] where artifactId, version, type, scope and classifier are optional. Wildcards may be used to replace an entire or just parts of a section.
      Examples:
       
        * org.apache.maven
        
        * org.apache.maven:badArtifact
        
        * org.apache.maven:artifact:badVersion
        
        * org.apache.maven:*:1.2 (exclude version 1.2 and above, equivalent to [1.2,) )

        * org.apache.maven:*:[1.2] (explicit exclude of version 1.2)
        
        * org.apache.maven:*:*:jar:test
        
        * *:*:*:jar:compile:tests

        * org.apache.*:maven-*:*
