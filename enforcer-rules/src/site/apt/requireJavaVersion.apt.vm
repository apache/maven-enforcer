Require Java Version

   This rule enforces certain Java JDK versions. The rule uses the {{{./versionRanges.html}Enforcer version range syntax}} to define allowed versions.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:
   
   * <<message>> - an optional message to the user if the rule fails.
   
   * <<version>> - {{{./versionRanges.html}range}} of allowed JDKs.

   * <<display>> -  flag to display the normalized JDK version.


   For JDK 1.8 you can also use simple <<<8>>> as <version> - it will be internally changed to <<<1.8>>>
   
   []

   The JDK version is retrieved and the following processing occurs before being checked:
   
  [[1]] Drop all non-numeric characters preceding the first number. (build 1.5.0_07-b03 becomes 1.5.0_07-b03)
  
  [[2]] Replace all '_' and '-' with '.' (1.5.0_07-b03 becomes 1.5.0.07.b03)
  
  [[3]] Remove all non digit characters "[^0-9] and convert each section using Integer.parseInt() (1.5.0_07-b03 becomes 1.5.0.7.3)
  
  [[3]] Split the string on '.' and take the first 3 sections, separated by '.' and add '-' followed by the fourth section (1.5.0.7.3 becomes 1.5.0-7)
  
  []
   
   This preprocessing normalizes various JDK version strings into a standard x.y.z-b version number.
   Your required range should therefore use the x.y.z-b format for comparison.
   There is an easy way to see how your current JDK string will be normalized, you can enable <<display>> option.

  If you would like to enforce a certain vendor string for the JDK, you would use the {{{./requireJavaVendor.html}RequireJavaVendor}} rule
