Ban Dependency Management Scope

  This rule bans all scope values except for {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies}<<<import>>>}} from dependencies within the dependency management.

   The following parameters are supported by this rule:
   
   * <<checkEffectivePom>> - if <<<true>>> the dependencyManagement from imports and parent pom's are checked as well, otherwise only the local dependencyManagement defined in the current project's pom.xml. Default is <<<false>>>.
   
   * <<excludes>> - a list of dependencies to ignore. The format is <<<groupId[:artifactId][:version][:type][:scope][:classifier]>>> where <<<artifactId>>>, <<<version>>>, <<<type>>>, <<<scope>>> and <<<classifier>>> are optional. Wildcards may be used to replace an entire or just parts of a section.
      Examples:
       
        * <<<org.apache.maven>>>
        
        * <<<org.apache.maven:someArtifact>>>
        
        * <<<org.apache.maven:artifact:someVersion>>>
        
        * <<<org.apache.maven:*:1.2>>> (exclude version 1.2 and above, equivalent to [1.2,) )

        * <<<org.apache.maven:*:[1.2]>>> (explicit exclude of version 1.2)
        
        * <<<org.apache.maven:*:*:jar:test>>>
        
        * <<<*:*:*:jar:compile:tests>>>

        * <<<org.apache.*:maven-*:*>>>
        
        []
   
   * <<message>> - an optional message to the user if the rule fails.
