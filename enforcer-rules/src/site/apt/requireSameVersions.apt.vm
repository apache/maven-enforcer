  This rule enforces that specific dependencies and/or plugins have the same version.


   The following parameters are supported by this rule:
   
   * dependencies - an optional list of dependency patterns
   
   * buildPlugins - an optional list of build plugin patterns
   
   * reportPlugins - an optional list of report plugin patterns
   
   * plugins - an optional list of both build and report plugin patterns
    
   * uniqueVersions - if SNAPSHOTs should be compared by their timestamped version or not. Default: false

   * searchTransitiveDependencies - if transitive dependencies should be searched. Default: false

   []
