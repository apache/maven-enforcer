   * <<banPluginRepositories>> - Whether to ban plugin repositories. By default they are banned (true).

   * <<allowedRepositories>> - Specify explicitly allowed non-plugin repositories. This is a list of ids.

   * <<allowedPluginRepositories>> - Specify explicitly allowed plugin repositories. This is a list of ids.

   * <<allowSnapshotRepositories>> - Whether to allow repositories which only resolve snapshots. By default they are banned (false).

   * <<allowSnapshotPluginRepositories>> - Whether to allow plugin repositories which only resolve snapshots. By default they are banned (false).
